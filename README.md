Social Network Friend Recommendation System ✨

A Social Network Friend Recommendation System is an exciting project that leverages graph theory concepts to simulate real-world social networks. This project allows students to explore data structures and algorithms while building a feature-rich application similar to popular social media platforms.

🔍 Project Overview

In this project:

Each user is represented as a node (or vertex) in a graph.

Friendships between users are represented as edges connecting the nodes.

By constructing and traversing this graph, the system provides valuable social insights, such as identifying mutual friends and recommending new connections. This mimics the friend suggestion features of popular social media platforms.

🔧 Key Features and Functions

1. 🧩 Add Friends

Enable users to form new friendships by creating edges between their nodes in the graph.

2. ❌ Delete Friends

Allow users to break friendships by removing edges from the graph.

3. 🧳 Display Mutual Friends

Help users discover mutual friends shared with another user by analyzing shared connections in the graph.

4. 🔍 Friend Recommendations

Suggest new friends by identifying friends-of-friends (nodes connected through mutual edges), as these users are more likely to have shared interests or connections.

5. 🖊️ User Posting System

Create a real-time activity feed:

Users can make posts, which are stored in First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) order.

Posts are displayed sequentially, simulating a timeline or feed feature.
